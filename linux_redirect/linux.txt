If you want to redirect a hostname to another URL on a Linux system, you generally need to use a web server. Here's how you can set up a simple redirect using Apache or Nginx:

### Using Apache:

1. **Install Apache:**
   If you don't have Apache installed, you can install it with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install apache2
   ```

2. **Configure a Virtual Host:**
   Edit the Apache configuration file for your virtual host. Open the configuration file in a text editor:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your-domain.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration, replacing `your-domain.com` with your actual domain and `https://new-domain.com` with the URL you want to redirect to:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName your-domain.com
       Redirect permanent / https://new-domain.com
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. **Enable the Site and Restart Apache:**
   Enable the site and restart Apache:

   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite your-domain.conf
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

### Using Nginx:

1. **Install Nginx:**
   If you don't have Nginx installed, you can install it with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```

2. **Configure a Server Block:**
   Edit the Nginx configuration file for your server block:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-domain
   ```

   Add the following configuration, replacing `your-domain.com` with your actual domain and `https://new-domain.com` with the URL you want to redirect to:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       return 301 https://new-domain.com$request_uri;
   }
   ```

3. **Enable the Site and Restart Nginx:**
   Enable the site and restart Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

After making these changes, when someone accesses `your-domain.com` in a web browser, they will be redirected to `https://new-domain.com`.

Remember to replace `your-domain.com` and `https://new-domain.com` with your actual domain and the desired redirect URL.
