To keep the network connection active even when you close the laptop, you can try a few different approaches:

Power Management Settings:

Open your power management settings.
Look for options related to what happens when the lid is closed.
Change the setting to "Do nothing" or a similar option for when the lid is closed.
This should prevent the system from disconnecting your network interface when the laptop is closed.
Terminal Commands:

Open a terminal and use the following command to disable sleep when the lid is closed:

sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
This command masks the sleep and suspend targets, preventing the system from going into those states when the lid is closed.


Custom Scripts:

Create a custom script to disable sleep when the lid is closed.
Open a text editor and create a new script, for example, prevent_lid_sleep.sh:

#!/bin/bash
echo "HandleLidSwitch=ignore" | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/logind.conf
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service

Save the script and make it executable with:

chmod +x prevent_lid_sleep.sh
Run the script with:

./prevent_lid_sleep.sh

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

System-wide initialization:

Move your script to a suitable location, for example, /usr/local/bin/:

sudo mv prevent_lid_sleep.sh /usr/local/bin/

Make sure it's executable:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/prevent_lid_sleep.sh

Create a systemd service file:


sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prevent-lid-sleep.service

Add the following content to the file:

[Unit]
Description=Prevent Lid Sleep

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prevent_lid_sleep.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

Make sure to adjust the ExecStart path to the actual path of your script.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Reload systemd to recognize the new service:


sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Enable the service to start on boot:


sudo systemctl enable prevent-lid-sleep.service

Now, your script should be executed on system startup. If you ever need to disable it, you can use:


sudo systemctl disable prevent-lid-sleep.service

This method is more in line with systemd, the modern init system used by many Linux distributions.
